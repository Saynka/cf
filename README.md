## Project: Cold Fusion - Take Home Evaluation

### Author: Kale Lesko

### Specifications

- Design and build a system to enter and display vehicles.
- It should support makes and models.
- We should be able to add/update the make, model, and vehicles.
- It should use classes and the classes should use inheritance.
- It should use a MySQL database and the schema should be provided when you turn this in.

### Notes

- It does not have to function or run. We’re not necessarily looking for a complete project (although if you do get a complete project done, it’s a major plus).
- It has to be done using HTML, CSS, and CFML (ColdFusion or Lucee) only.
- If you want to try to get it to run, Lucee is a good free alternative to ColdFusion (this is what we use in production).
- You can turn it in via Google Drive, Github, Zip file, etc.
